# SPSU Sans Font

SPSU Sans is derived from the typeface defined in 1931 by the German
standards body DIN in the standard sheet DIN 1451-Schriften (typefaces).
The typeface was specifically designed for legibility and intended for use
on technical drawings and documentation. 

According to the SPSU style guide:

>It was selected for its clean, angular lines, uniform proportions and “engineering” like qualities.

Like the original DIN spec, SPSU Sans is available in both regular and condensed
versions for use when space is limited, for example notes on a drawing. It is also
available in a wide selection of weights.
